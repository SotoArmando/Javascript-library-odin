# PROJECT: LIBRARY

This is the first project of the Main JavaScript curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

The objective is to create a book library with the following features.

- The project demonstrates the use of `Objects` and `Object Constructor`.
- `render()` is used to populate data to the page (`HTML`)
- Add a `form` to add new book
- Add a `button` on each book’s display to `delete` the book.
- Add a `button` on each book’s display to change it’s `read` status.
- Add some persistence to the library app by using [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)
